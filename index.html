          <h2>About Dr. Kwame Nkruma</h2>
          <p>
            Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, the founding father of Ghana, was born on
            September 21, 1909, in Nkroful, in the Western Region of the Gold
            Coast (now Ghana). He was a teacher, political theorist, and
            revolutionary who led Ghana to independence from British rule in
            1957. He became the first Prime Minister and later the first
            President of Ghana. Known globally for his strong stance on African
            unity and anti-colonialism, he is celebrated as a key figure in the
            Pan-African movement.
